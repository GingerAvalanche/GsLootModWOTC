You created an XCOM 2 Mod Project!

Changes from original mod:
- Fixed Restorative Mist item ability to not target machines (this may have been an intentional change to the ability by Grimy, but it doesn't make thematic sense, so it's gone)

Updates for XPack:
-All item-added abilities updated to work with hero classes the same way their corresponding class abilities work with the hero classes
-Added support for XPack hero class weapons being drawn from lockboxes
